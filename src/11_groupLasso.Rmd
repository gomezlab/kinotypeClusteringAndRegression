This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
require(glmnet)
require(caret)
require(dplyr)
require(e1071)
require(doMC)
require(gglasso)
```
#### read in the data
#### the growth has been interpolated to the Klaeger 2017 (Kuster lab) concentrations to go directly from kinase inhibition -> growth rates 

```{r}
dat <- read.csv('~/Github/subnetGRcurves/data/interpolated_conc_df.csv')
dat <- data.frame(dat)
dat$Cellline <- as.factor(dat$Cellline)
head(dat)

```

#### extract the resposne variable (y) and the predictor variables (X)
```{r}

y <- dat$Growth
X <- dat[c(2,5:dim(dat)[2])]
X <- as.matrix(model.matrix(~., X))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
