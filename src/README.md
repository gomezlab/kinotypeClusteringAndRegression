This folder contains the source code to construct, weight, and analyze the Kinase Interaction Network.

Files:
##### TBD

Note:

Files beginning with `network_` correspond to the Kinase Interaction Network clustering generation and analysis. Files beginning with  `reg_` correspond to the GRMetrics response prediction, with some usage of the `network_` files. 

Files are in approximate dependency order numerically, i.e. `network_04_GOLearnability.ipynb` depends on `network_[01, 02, 03]` files etc.
